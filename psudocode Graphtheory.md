Graph G
   Nodes V = set of users and books
   Edges E = set of connections between users and books

Algorithm IdentifyReadingCommunities(Graph G)
   For each user u in V
      For each user v in V
         If connectivity(u, v) exists
            Mark u and v as part of the same reading community

   Return identified reading communities


    Algorithm AvoidRecommendationsForAlreadyReadBooks(users, books)
       For each user i in users
          Set A_i as the set of books already read by user i

       Initialize recommended_books as the set of all books

       For k from 1 to number of users
          For each combination C of k users
             Calculate the intersection of their already-read sets: A_C = A_{i_1} ∩ A_{i_2} ∩ ... ∩ A_{i_k}
             Update recommended_books using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

       Return recommended_books


    
    Algorithm AnalyzeBookGenresDistribution(book_genres)
       Initialize G(x) as the generating function
       For each genre k in book_genres
          Add g_k * x^k to G(x)
    
       Return G(x)
    
    
    Algorithm RealTimeAdaptation(recommended_books, user_feedback, adaptation_rate)
       Initialize R_n as the recommended book list
       For each iteration n
          Calculate the next recommended book list: R_{n+1} = R_n + adaptation_rate * (user_feedback - R_n)
    
       Return the final recommended book list
